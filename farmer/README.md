# Example app with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)

This example features how to use [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app.

We are connecting the Next.js `_app.js` with `chakra-ui`'s Theme and ColorMode containers so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.

## Farm

### Plant
1. If allowance is not enough, it calls `approve` function on the pool token contract, to allow the "farm contract" to move tokens for the signer
2. It calls `openFarm` function

### Harvest
1. It claims for all the possible incentives for the signer with `claimFor`.
2. It closes entirely the farm for the signer, by calling `closeFarm`.
